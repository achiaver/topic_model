# Replicated Softmax Model

This project is part of my masters degree thesis.

Based on the paper [Replicated Softmax: An Undirected Topic Model](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2009/file/31839b036f63806cba3f47b93af8ccb5-Paper.pdf) by R. Salakhutdinov and G. Hinton (2009).

There are other github project with the implementation of the same neural network archtecture, however, here our implementation is done in [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/).

# The Artificial Neural Network

Replicated Softmax Model (RSM) is a variation of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, and it this case it is applied to topic modeling branch of Natural Language Processing area.
